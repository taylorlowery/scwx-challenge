# Secureworks QA Automation Engineer Coding Challenge

## The Coding Challenge: 
1. Read input from a file of words
2. Find the largest word in the file
3. Transpose the letters in the largest word
4. Show the largest word and the largest word transposed 
5. Demonstrate positive and negative test cases
6. Ensure you document code and instructions for building and running based on the response best practices above

### Example file:
```
a
ab
abc
abcd
abcde
```

### Example output:
```
abcde
edcba
```

## Assumptions
For the purposes of this challenge, I assumed that all text input would be submitted as .txt files, and that the strings in the text input would be separated by standard english whitespace (ex: spaces, tabs, and newlines).
